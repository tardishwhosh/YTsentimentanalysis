 will not be rewarded with his favourite one happiness.

If sadness would not be good, then why I go to watch emotional movies. These movies don’t give me any smile or laughter rather they make my eyes wet.

I like it because I enjoy being the part of character’s sadness. It means I like being sad and wanna feel this emotion too. And so do you all.

I listen to songs which make me cry and I love to indulge into the emotions of the song. Does that mean I love crying? Absolutely I do. Because sometimes I need tears more than the flattering lips.

The word happiness will lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. — Carl Jung

The smile is being so overrated and people have become obsessed for getting this ingredient on their plate.

Sorry to say but even successful down people are victimized taking it wrongly. They are giving ways to become happy and how to fade away this sadness. Why is there any need of fading the sadness?
